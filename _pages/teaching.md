<h2>Comments from Teaching Evaluations</h2>

<ul>
    <li>“Guanghong is amazing! He is super helpful and very easy to talk to. He always responds to his emails, and he helped me understand concepts when I asked him after section. He <strong>always asked us what topics we wanted to discuss beforehand</strong>, whether it be past midterms or even homework. He is an amazing TA!"</li>
    <li>“Guanghong was extremely effective in communicating all the materials to us. He also <strong>catered his lessons towards our needs and asked us what we wanted before he started teaching</strong>, and that helped because I would ask all the questions I wanted, and he would answer them."</li>
    <li>“He allowed for <strong>largely student-directed learning</strong> so that we could focus on what we were uncomfortable with and avoid wasting time."</li>
    <li>“Guanghong is a wonderful TA! He was very <strong>enthusiastic to get everyone involved</strong>."</li>
    <li>“Guanghong was <strong>very enthusiastic</strong> while teaching. He is very attentive to his students and enforces his teaching in his discussions, <strong>ensuring everyone understands</strong> the class's content."</li>
    <li>“Great at breaking down lectures and providing more examples of the course content. Going to the section was worth it since I knew I was going to learn something or solidify my understanding of the topics discussed. No weaknesses or suggestions. He was very helpful and had a great attitude in every class and a strong desire to teach and make sure we understood the content. He always encourages us to <strong>think critically</strong> and have <strong>enough interaction</strong> with us."</li>
    <li>“He would <strong>make us engage with him</strong> and work through the questions with him. I liked the examples he gave and how he asked for student participation frequently."</li>
    <li>“Used both <strong>graphs and logicality</strong> to explain problems. Gave us <strong>different perspectives on similar problems</strong>, allowing us to solve them in the way we were most comfortable with."</li>
    <li>“He has been my best TA up to date! He really knows what he is doing. I could tell <strong>he truly cared</strong> and that's really all that matters."</li>
    <li>“Guanghong is probably the most prepared TA that I have seen throughout my three years here. Guanghong is always prepared with an agenda of what to review that day, and he is very helpful in answering his students' questions, validating their opinions, and even acknowledging limitations to certain arguments. He <strong>genuinely wants his students to succeed</strong>, and it was a pleasure getting to know him throughout the quarter."</li>

Welcome! 

Iâ€™m an Economist at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/author/guanghong-xu), with a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of California, Santa Cruz.

My academic research lies at the intersection of Development Economics, Applied Econometrics, and Bayesian Statistics, with a particular focus on the economic development of lower-income countries. I study issues related to technology adoption, quality upgrading, value chains, and financial inclusion.

I was also a Visiting Economist at the [CGIAR International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI)](https://www.ilri.org/). I lived in East Africa for four years, designing and directing randomized field experiments (RCTs) across Kenya (36 months), Rwanda (10 months), and Tanzania (1 month).

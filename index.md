Welcome! 

Iâ€™m an Economist at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/author/guanghong-xu), with a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of California, Santa Cruz.

During my Ph.D., my research focused on Development Economics, Applied Econometrics, and Bayesian Statistics, with an emphasis on the economic development of lower-income countries. My work emphasizes quality upgrading, value chains, technology adoption, and financial inclusion. 

I was also a Visiting Economist at the [CGIAR International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI)](https://www.ilri.org/). I conducted extensive fieldwork in Kenya (36 months), Rwanda (10 months), and Tanzania (1 month).
